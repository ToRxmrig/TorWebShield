## Setup Script

To automate the installation and configuration process, use the provided setup script. This script installs Apache2, Tor, and other necessary tools, sets up services, and configures permissions for secure operation.

**[Download the setup.sh script](https://github.com/jrpm402/tor-service/blob/main/setup.sh)**

Simply download the script, make it executable, and run it with appropriate privileges. For example:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
